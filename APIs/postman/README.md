# Postman Collections :tada:

Here's a set of useful collections that you can import into your environment.

### `FOSSA Licenses`

This collection is useful is you want to bulk modify certain existing policies in your organization. 
Run the collection to quickly approve, flag, deny or even uncategorize licenses within your policies.


### `Uploading SBOMs via the API`

This collection provides examples for uploading SBOMs through the API. You'll need a FOSSA API key that's capable of adding new projects.
